**Key Features:**

* Comprehensive course content: Access all the code, exercises, and explanations from the course.
* Learn by building: Create a visually stunning and interactive cellular ecosystem.
* Master OOP fundamentals: Understand classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, dependency injection, and composition.
* Visualize your code: Use UML diagrams to understand your code's structure.
* Real-world applications: Solve programming challenges and build professional-quality code.

**Cell Simulation Overview:**

The cellular ecosystem simulation project is a practical application of OOP concepts. In this simulation, you'll create a virtual environment populated by various types of cells. Each cell will have its own unique characteristics, such as color, size, and behavior. Cells will interact with each other and their environment, leading to emergent behaviors and complex dynamics. This project provides an excellent opportunity to apply OOP principles to design and implement a realistic and engaging simulation.
